powerline-shell doesn't work immediately
	python might need to be installed via brew (for pip?)
	powerline might need to be installed via pip
	* actually, powerline needs to be cloned from git repo *
	test for powerline shell folder doesn't work bc the repo already has empty folder.
need dependencies list?
screenshot save location (not really dotfiles but)
remove/update docker helper stuff
* Check that nvm install at end of bash_profile is correct- ie it will work before nvm is installed?
